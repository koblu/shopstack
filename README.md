# ShopstackApp

## About

This is a test Angular project I created, with the idea to simulate a small online marketplace, mostly to get more experience creating a full stack application.

I connected it to an AWS S3 Bucket and an AWS NoSQL DB, and created a flow to upload documents. The styling for each component was created with vanilla CSS. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Further work

This project, for the most part, is deprecated. I might continue work on it in the future, but that's tenuous at best. 

It needs more robust authentication, as well as the ability to create user accounts.
